# Improvement loop

A standing loop over the China Data Explorer: each round audits one surface,
fixes what it finds, deploys, verifies on the live site, and records the
result here so the next round (or the next session) starts from the queue,
not from scratch. Rounds are small on purpose.

## How a round runs

1. Pick the top item from the queue (or whatever the last round surfaced).
2. Reproduce it on the live site, not just locally.
3. Fix, typecheck (`bunx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json | grep china-explorer`
   must print nothing), `bun test`, commit, `railway up --detach`, then
   verify the fix on the live URL.
4. Log it below and add anything the round surfaced to the queue.

## Queue (highest value first)

- Backup of the Railway volume: nightly upload of `china.db` to a bucket the
  owner controls. Blocked on a bucket; rebuilding from NBS is thirty minutes,
  revision history is not rebuildable.
- Related series on NBS pages: siblings in the same category, one query.
- Merchandise Trade split into separate Exports and Imports series (owner's
  call).
- Merge `china-data-explorer` into `main` (owner's call).
- Lone year-range slices under a different parent (seven PPI-by-industry
  tables) stay unstitched; decide whether to merge by name.
- Provinces page: a period selector that also drives the province detail
  sparkline window.

## Log

- 2026-09-09 round 1: search ranked discontinued series ("Crude steel
  sales, year to date", ended 2019) above current ones because the ranker
  had no idea which series still publish. With the full catalog stored, each
  result now carries its stored date range; ranking prefers series with a
  period in the last two years; results show "1998 to 2019 ended" or
  "1989 to Jul 2026".
